# The Ultimate Jourlang
An epic journey of Erlang proportions through the *Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good* online book. Since the solutions are freely available on the website, they will not be tracked here **I SHOULD NOT EVEN MODIFY THEM** for they are :sparkles:*The Source of Ertruth*:pray:. In the name of Mollusk, forever and ever :ramen:.

Basically, there will be much recursion, the base case of which is :microscope: computer science. Once I have descended deep enough into the recursion, i.e. dived close enough to the metal, I will resurface to a comfortable depth in the Elixir and continue my recursion from that point. Should any of this be unclear, please refer to [this](https://github.com/BlakeTidwell/lysefgg/blob/master/README.md) :expressionless: for greater clarity.
